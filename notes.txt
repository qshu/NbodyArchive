   DTNEW, XPREV not necessary


   energy_mpi - same changes as in energy.f necessary
 

   nbint.f   COMMON BLACKFORCE not necessary anymore

 

   nbint.f   COMMON BLACKFORCE not necessary anymore
             and check FRR,FDD,FBL
 
   setup.f what about initial adaptation of X,XDOT to black hole?
           seems to be switched off.

   steps.f  initial start with very small STEP


   watch out for 0.01 in R2DENS / dragforce.f dragforce1.f
         this is VERY dangereous! not dimensionless number

   go from 1,N for EBLCKHL in energy.f energy_mpi.f

   one superfluous output line in intgrt.f removed at manual termination
