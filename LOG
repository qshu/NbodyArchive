  very tight binary, member gets kick, regularised with high positive energy, then MPI trouble

chewbacca Nov. 3, after boundscheck switched on; related to regcor_gpu - omp issue?
 It seems LISTV(1).GT.0 , but no element in LISTV(2) ..

 restart with KZ(37) = 0


problems with bound check:
At line 248 of file ../src/Main/checkl.F Fortran runtime error: Index '0' of dimension 2 of array 'x' below lower bound of 1
At line 58 of file ../src/Main/rmesc_tlist.f
Fortran runtime error: Index '0' of dimension 1 of array 'ndtk' below lower bound of 1


withouy bound check but -g on luke:
