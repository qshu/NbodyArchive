                         NBODY6++
                         --------

    This is a source code plus Makefile package of the massively parallel
 variant NBODY6++ (by R. Spurzem) of NBODY6 from Sverre Aarseth. It is provided here freely for
 everybody to test, but for any serious use I would require you to
 inform me about it. No warranty of any kind is taken for the proper
 function of the code. To use it, untar and unpack, check the Makefile
 which hardware you want (good luck that you find yours...), say make xxx
 where xxx is your selection according to hardware, and run by  ./nbody6 < in1000.

 For further details, input parameters etc please contact Rainer Spurzem
 (spurzem@ari.uni-heidelberg.de), also if you are interested to be included
 in the informal NBODY6++ mailing list, receiving messages about updates
 and bug fixes which occur several times a year. 

 Note added in January 2007: an updated version of NBODY6++ is already in
 preparation for quite some time. The package  nb6mpi-new.tar.gz
 contains an intermediate snapshot, used at the cambody summer school in
 August 2007. It is more consistent with the already updated Manual
 at  nb6++manual-new.pdf , but still does NOT contain all of Sverre's
 updates.

    Have fun and good luck

    Rainer Spurzem

 (Note: though the formal status of this paper is subm. to MNRAS we have neglected
 its final brush-up and resubmission for long time, but still it is the best
 detailed source of information what is going on in NBODY6++).
