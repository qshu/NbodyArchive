Preferred Port is Sunday, Mar 15, noon from San Pedro to Two Harbours, return Tuesday Mar 17, afternoon (e.g. 16:00) to Long Beach. Is there a ferry on Tuesday from Two Harbours? If not, how can one get from Two Harbours to Avalon? Many thanks and kind regards Rainer Spurzem

PS: I am currently staying at UC Santa Barbara (see telephone numbers) but have given my original German home address.
