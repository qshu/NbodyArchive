  dehnen-100-b1-50k.asc                input data on unit 10

Runtime:
  1h 00m 59s

Status:
  Killed

Description:
This run was 50k Dehnen model. Here are the its parameters, which I calculated
with my own code:
  Total mass = 0.998003
  Half mass radius = 2.427408
  Total energy = -0.082924
So it's not scaled to the usual units, but it is in good virial equilibrium
(Ekin = 0.0825); I ran it with KZ(22)=6 so this is supposed to fix the scaling
issues.
Note the VERY small eta, 1e-3 (both reg. and irr.), and VERY small adjustment
and diagnosis time, 1e-4.
The simulation got stuck stopped generating output after a few minutes. It did
not respond to creating a STOP file and had to be killed manually.

  dehnen-100-b1-50k-flatcore.asc       input data on unit 10

Runtime:
  47m 41s

Status:
  Reached T = 0.0212402
  Stopped using a STOP file
  The word OVERFLOW appeared in the output 184,109 times.

Description:
This is a similar model with the innermost region (Rc = 0.1 * Rs) is replaced by
a CONSTANT DENSITY core. This means removing 1914 stars and replacing them with
the same number of stars, drawn from a uniform density. For the x-, y-, and
z-velocities of the new stars were drawn from a normal distribution with the
same dispersion as the original, removed, stars. This isn't the smartest thing
but good enough and could be done quickly. Another difference is that I used the
gpu_8 queue with n=8.

  dehnen-100-b1-50k-flatcore.asc       input data on unit 10

Runtime:
  2h 00m 08s

Status:
  Reached T = 4.91016
  Stopped due to reaching TCOMP
  The word OVERFLOW appeared in the output 309,151 times.

Description:
I used the same Dehnen model with flat core as job 26585, but reset some
parameters in the input file to their more `usual' values:
ETAI = ETAR = 0.01
DTADJ = DELTAT = 0.01
