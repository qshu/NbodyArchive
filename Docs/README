This directory contains several useful files for running NBODY6:

nbody6.tex is a TeX file which lists all the routines in dir Ncode.
nbody6.ps is the corresponding ps file.

chain.tex is a TeX file which lists routines in dirs Chain & Nchain.

input is a simple test input file.

nbody2.ps is a ps file of the New Astronomy paper (2001) which explains
all details of the code NBODY2.
It should be useful for providing relevant information about NBODY6
since no equivalent manual exists.

COMMON2 lists all common variables in NBODY2, many of which are used
by NBODY6.

NBODY5 shows the structure of code NBODY5 which is similar to NBODY6.

write5.tex is an old TeX file explaining details of NBODY5.

refs gives some of the main references to relevant papers.

poster.tex is a LayTeX file from Rome Chaos meeting announcing NBODY6.

To compile, type 'make nbody6' in dir Ncode.
